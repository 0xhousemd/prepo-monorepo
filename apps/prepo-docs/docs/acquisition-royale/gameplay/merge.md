# Merge

- You can voluntarily merge two of your Enterprises together for a cost of 6 RP (or 6 MATIC).
- When merging, you choose which of the two Enterprises you want to keep and which one you want to burn. The Enterprise you keep will earn an extra +1 RP/day and will absorb 75% of the burnt Enterpriseâ€™s RP.
- After merging, the merged Enterprise will have immunity for 2 days. This immunity will be lost immediately if it performs a compete, acquire, or merge action.
