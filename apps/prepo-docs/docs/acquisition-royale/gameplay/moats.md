# Moats

- Feature coming soon!
- An Enterprise has a Moat if it has an RP balance above the Moat Threshold of 50 RP.
- A Moated Enterprise cannot be acquired immediately.
- To acquire a Moated Enterprise, their RP balance must be competed below the Moat Threshold and stay there for 48 consecutive hours, after which they can be acquired immediately like any other Non-Moated Enterprise.
  - A Moated Enterprise's RP balance can be competed all the way down to zero, but cannot be acquired until 48 consecutive hours below the Moat Threshold have passed.
- The Moat mechanic gives established Enterprises a chance to recover in the face of strong competition.
