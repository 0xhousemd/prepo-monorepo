# Intern Tasks

- Each day, anyone can claim 0.5 RP for free by completing 3 ‘intern task’ transactions. No Enterprise or MATIC is required (except for gas costs).
- This can be thought of as an RP faucet, allowing anyone to earn their way into purchasing an Enterprise, or earn some extra RP to help them complete RP-denominated actions or purchases even faster.
- The 3 transactions can be seen as an anti-spam measure, mitigating against RP being dumped on secondary markets at a cost below the total gas cost of the 3 transactions.
