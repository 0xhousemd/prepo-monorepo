# FAQ

## General

### What is prePO?

prePO is a decentralized trading platform allowing anyone to gain synthetic exposure to any pre-IPO stock or pre-IDO token.

### What is prePO's mission?

prePO's mission is to democratize pre-public investing - transforming a world of financial exclusion into a world of permissionless access.

### Where does the name prePO come from?

prePO stands for "pre Public Offering", as opposed to IPO (Initial Public Offering).

### How do you pronounce prePO?

pree-pee-oh!

### Are prePO positions backed by real shares/tokens?

No. Positions on prePO are synthetic, which means rather than needing to acquire large quantities of real shares or tokens (not scalable), all positions are instead fully-collateralized by USDC (infinitely scalable).

### How are prices determined on prePO?

Before going public, a market's price (fully-diluted valuation) is determined purely by supply and demand.

After going public, the market concludes at a fixed settlement price corresponding to the fully-diluted valuation at the end of the first day of public trading.

### Is prePO audited?

Yes, prePO's smart contracts are audited by Code4rena.

### Who are prePO's investors?

prePO's investors include Republic Capital, IOSG Ventures, Maven 11, The LAO; founders from Gnosis, 1inch, Illuvium, Alchemix, Moonbeam, Zapper; and many more!

Most of prePO's investors are listed on the [main website](https://prepo.io/) (scroll down).

### Why is prePO launching on Arbitrum?

prePO will launch on Arbitrum - an Ethereum 'layer 2' scaling solution - due to its high speed, low fees (that should get lower over time), security (maintains the security guarantees of Ethereum), and DeFi ecosystem.

### Will prePO launch on other chains/networks?

prePO is chain-agnostic, meaning it will ultimately end up on the chain/network that makes the most sense for the protocol.

### Will prePO go multi-chain?

This is unlikely in the short-to-medium-term, as it would split the liquidity and userbase, and adds complexity.

### Who founded prePO?

Xavier Ekkel ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavierekkel/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/XavierEkkel)) - an experienced smart contract engineer, ex-Canva software engineer, and former game developer, who has been in the crypto space for almost a decade.

### How big is the prePO team?

prePO has 8+ team members, currently with a heavy engineering focus.

### Where is the team based?

prePO's team is fully-remote and globally-distributed.

### Is prePO hiring?

Yes! See our [jobs page](https://url.prepo.io/jobs).

## Token

### What is PPO?

PPO is prePOâ€™s governance and utility token.

### What is the purpose of the PPO token?

The purpose of the PPO token is to incentivize high-quality, active participation and long-term alignment with the prePO platform, protocol, and DAO.

### When will the PPO token be launching?

September 20th 00:00 UTC, alongside the [PPO Token Presale](https://url.prepo.io/blog-presale-docs).

### What chain/network will the PPO token be launching on?

Arbitrum.

### Will the PPO token launch on other chains/networks in the future?

Potentially - however for now it makes sense to keep everything unified on one chain.

### How can I buy PPO tokens?

Initially, PPO tokens will only be purchasable via the [PPO Token Presale](https://url.prepo.io/blog-presale-docs) and potential future sale events on [sale.prepo.io](https://sale.prepo.io/).

After transferability is enabled, PPO tokens will be purchasable from decentralized exchanges (e.g. Uniswap) and potentially some centralized exchanges (to be announced).

### How can I earn PPO tokens?

After the token launch, PPO tokens will be earnable in [various other ways](https://docs.prepo.io/tokenomics#earning-ppo).

### How can I see my PPO balance?

Your PPO balance is viewable on [sale.prepo.io](https://sale.prepo.io/).

### Why is PPO starting as non-transferable and non-tradable?

There are many benefits to launching a token as non-transferable initially:

- Demonstrates that the token holders are the ones determining that the token should be transferable and tradable
- Delays the need to provide (or source) a large amount of capital upfront to provide liquidity for the PPO token
- Allows for more time to finalize and test the PPO protocol-owned liquidity strategy
- Reduces focus on price (including negative community sentiment during a bear market or distracting noise from hype)
- Increases quality of community members (long-term believers rather than short-term speculators)
- Allows for utility and integrations to be incrementally added
- Allows for a wider distribution of the token to commence sooner
- Introduces a key incentive device (the token) which can be used for community/user growth and attracting key talent
- Allow for treasury swaps and collaborations with other DAOs/projects to occur more easily

### What can I do with PPO tokens while transfers are restricted?

PPO tokens will still be fully-functional for certain purposes - such as governance, staking and rewards - even prior to unrestricted transfers are enabled.

### When will unrestricted transfers (and trading) be enabled?

PPO holders can vote to enable full transferability if they deem it to be in the best interest of prePO.

Some prerequisites that token holders may want to meet before enabling full transferability could include:

- A sufficiently-decentralized fully-functional governance system
- A widely distributed token holder base
- The launch of the PPO staking system (allows for time-weighted and achievement-weighted voting power)
- The launch of the core platform
- Sufficient traction / product-market fit on the core platform
- Determining that enabling transfers would comply with all applicable laws
- The return of a crypto bull market (to protect the treasury's protocol-owned liquidity and avoid negative sentiment around price in a bear market)

### Will there be an airdrop?

There are no current plans for an airdrop in the traditional sense. Instead, prePO will be exploring sale discounts / incentives / other benefits for engaged and long-term-oriented users / community members.

### What is the total supply of PPO?

1 billion PPO tokens.

### What does the PPO token distribution look like?

- Community Treasury 58.9% (including public sales)
- Seed Round 8.8%
- Strategic Round 5.3%
- Team 25%
- Charity 2%

### How will the treasury PPO allocation be used?

PPO in the treasury could be used for incentives, liquidity bootstrapping, sales (including the [Presale](https://url.prepo.io/blog-presale-docs)), and new initiatives.

Token holders can propose how this PPO is utilized.
