## Testnet

### What do I need in order to try the testnet?

Anyone can explore the UI [here](https://app.prepo.io/).

However, in order to make trades you will need:
- a crypto wallet that supports Goerli Testnet (e.g. MetaMask)
- Goerli ETH (for gas fees)
- testnet funds ('FAKEUSD')

### How do I receive testnet funds ('FAKEUSD')?

To receive testnet funds ('FAKEUSD'), simply fill out our [whitelist form](https://url.prepo.io/whitelist-dapp).

Once you've filled out the form, your testnet funds will be sent within a minute.

Once your testnet funds have been sent, the banner on the app will change to green and will include a link to the [Deposit page](https://app.prepo.io/portfolio/deposit).

### Where can I receive Goerli (Testnet) ETH?

You will receive a small amount of Goerli ETH by filling out our [whitelist form](https://url.prepo.io/whitelist-dapp).

If you need more Goerli ETH, you can get more from [this faucet](https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/).

### How do I try out the testnet?

Once you have FAKEUSD and Goerli ETH, you can deposit your FAKEUSD from the [Deposit page](https://app.prepo.io/portfolio/deposit).

Once you have funds deposited, you can start trading from the [Markets page](https://app.prepo.io/markets)!

### What can I trade on the testnet?

There are two testnet markets: 'preFakeStock' and 'preFakeToken'.

These markets are intentionally not real to make it clear that the values on testnet have no real-world meaning.

However, they do allow users to get a feel for the real user experience.

### What else can I do on the testnet?

New features - including token-related features such as staking and governance - will launch first on the testnet.
