# Acquire

- An Enterprise can forcibly acquire another Enterprise for a cost of 10 RP (or 10 MATIC) plus however much RP it costs to Compete the other Enterprise’s RP to zero.
- When acquiring, you choose which of the two Enterprises you want to keep and which one you want to burn. The Enterprise you keep will earn an extra +2 RP/day and will absorb 75% of the burnt Enterprise’s RP (if it has any).
- After merging, the upgraded Enterprise will have immunity for 4 days. This immunity will be lost immediately if it performs a compete, acquire, or merge action.
